/* Opaque handle to the underlying persistent connection.

For various purposes, e.g. testing or failover, there might be
multiple Terab instances available. Also, since each connection
may only be accessed from a single thread, multiple connections
may be used from a single process to support multi-threaded access.

The connection handle offers the possibility to interact with
multiple instances and/or from multiple threads, without implicitly
enforcing a "shared" configuration at the process level.

A shorter way to reference a block instead of using its 32-byte
block id. Block handles are specific to a connection, they
cannot be reused between connections and must instead be
re-generated from the block id.

An open (uncommitted) block may become corrupt or lost due to
events on the Terab server outside the control of the client. When
this happens, requests on the block result in TERAB_ERR_BLOCK_CORRUPT,
and the block must be opened again and all its contents rewritten.

An older block may become unknown if another block is committed and
the common ancestor of the two blocks is so old that Terab chooses to
prune the branch.
