/* Opaque handle to the underlying persistent connection. 

   For various purposes, e.g. testing or failover, there might be 
   multiple Terab instances available. Also, since each connection
   may only be accessed from a single thread, multiple connections
   may be used from a single process to support multi-threaded access.
   
   The connection handle offers the possibility to interact with 
   multiple instances and/or from multiple threads, without implicitly 
   enforcing a "shared" configuration at the process level.

   A shorter way to reference a block instead of using its 32-byte
   block id. Block handles are specific to a connection, they 
   cannot be reused between connections and must instead be 
   re-generated from the block id. 

   An open (uncommitted) block may become corrupt or lost due to 
   events on the Terab server outside the control of the client. When 
   this happens, requests on the block result in TERAB_ERR_BLOCK_CORRUPT,
   and the block must be opened again and all its contents rewritten.

   An older block may become unknown if another block is committed and
   the common ancestor of the two blocks is so old that Terab chooses to 
   prune the branch.

     data specified for this block by previous calls to `terab_utxo_write_txs`
     (or the current one, if the same outpoint appears more than once).

   Validation rules: 

   - Submitting a `txo_t` that is identical to the current state of the
     outpoint on the terab instance is always valid (by idempotence).

   - The `txo_t.produced` and `txo_t.spent` represent production or 
     spending events for the transaction output in the chain leading up 
     to `block`. An event can only be changed if it has not yet happened
     (a value of zero) or if it has happened in `block`, events that happened
     in other blocks can no longer be changed.
     
     When an event can be changed, the corresponding field may only be set to 
     `block` (to indicate that the event occurred in the current block) or to
     zero (to undo a previous write that set the field to `block`, thereby
     "deleting" the event).
     
   - If `txo_t.produced` is zero, then `txo_t.spent` must also be zero
     (must produce before spending).

   - The `txo_t.satoshi` and `txo_t.payload` values can never be changed 
     once they are set (and there is no reasonable situation where they 
     would need to be changed). The will be the same for all chains in terab
     (not just for the chain leading up to `block`). 
     
     However, if they are already set, then they may be omitted (all bits 
     set to zero), in which case the existing values will be kept.

   This method is IDEMPOTENT.
